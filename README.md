Project Programming Technique II

The UTM Food project aims to create an online ordering system for food from various food 
vendors on and near the UTM campus. To accomplish this, a thorough class diagram has been 
created that illustrate the structure and connections among the most important system 
components. Association, Aggregation and Composition concept will be implemented in the 
class diagram.
