15 june 2023/thursday:
I have done vendor display, vendor selection and menuitem display in test2.cpp in order to no lose the older version.
During the process of coding i faced some errors i'm clueless about, where it says:
1. use of deleted function 'std::basic_fstream<_CharT, _Traits>::basic_fstream(const std::basic_fstream<_CharT, _Traits>&) [with _CharT = char; _Traits = std::char_traits<char>]' Ln185 in test2.cpp
2. use of deleted function 'MenuItem::MenuItem(const MenuItem&)' Ln446 in test2.cpp
